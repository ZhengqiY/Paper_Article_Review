### Summary:
weights can now be stored in local on-chip memory within dedicated neural cores
store weights in local chip memory (neural cores)

One-bit spike for computation and communication

neuron's state variable update, spike emitted rule for each tick
### Disucssion:
uncontrained deep learning domains such as deeply supervised networks (34) and modified gradient optimization rules
